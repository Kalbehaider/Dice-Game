# Dice Game  🎊 🎈

This is an implementation of the Dice game based on the tutorial by Jonas Schmedtmann in his JavaScript course.

## Game Rules 🤩⭐

- The game consists of 2 players who play in rounds.
- In each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they wish. Each roll adds to the player's ROUND score.
- However, if a player rolls a 1, their ROUND score is lost, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which adds their ROUND score to their GLOBAL score. After that, it becomes the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on the GLOBAL score wins the game.
